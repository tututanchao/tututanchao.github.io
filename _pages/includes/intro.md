I am a professor and master's supervisor at School of Computer and Electronic Information /School of Artificial Intelligence, Nanjing Normal University, with a primary research focus on machine learning and data mining. 

I received my bachelor's and master's degrees from Southeast University, my Ph.D. from Tongji University, and completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Southeast University. I am a visiting scholar sponsored by the China Scholarship Council (CSC). I serve as a committee member of the Artificial Intelligence & Pattern Recognition Committee of China Computer Federation (CCF), and the Visual Big Data Committee of the Chinese Society for Image and Graphics (CSIG-BVD). I have led several projects including a National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) Project and a Youth Project, a sub-project of a key research and development plan project funded by the Science and Technology Department of Jiangsu Province, a China Postdoctoral Science Foundation project, and a Jiangsu Higher Education Science Foundation project. 

As a first author or corresponding author, I have published over 30 papers in top-tier SCI journals and conferences such as IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE), IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics (TCYB), Pattern Recognition (PR), Knowledge-Based Systems (KBS), AAAI, IJCAI, PRCV, KSEM, IJCNN, ADMA, PRICAI, among others. I served as a session chair at PRICAI 2018 and have reviewed articles for multiple SCI journals and international conferences including Pattern Recognition, EAAI and Neurocomputing, IJCAI, AAAI and ACM MM. I was awarded the ACM Nanjing Chapter's Rising Star Award in 2021.
